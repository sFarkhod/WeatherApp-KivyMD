# WeatherApp-KivyMD

## This is just a small weather app that created with Python and Kivy.

### For using this app just install all dependencies inside **requirements.txt**. For additional I would suggest to installKivy by yourself because sometimes some environments cannot install it. Write following command to installing all dependencies

> pip install -r requirements.txt
